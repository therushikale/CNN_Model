# CNN_Model

1.Training and testing Object file Storage
We have collected the data for some hand and leg bones. The data is in the
form of images, at the time of accessing the image data time consumption of
that is more than the normal calculation of machine learning textual data. For
this we have a solution to preprocess the data and convert the data in the
form of python object files and save that. The process of creating an image
array at every step of training and testing of all images is skipped by using
python object files. The image data will get converted into the image array
object and get saved at once, after that we will just use that object file for
training and testing purposes.

2. Deep Learning Module
In this module we are applying many types of CNN architecture for building
the Deep Learning models. The models are evaluated on the basis of the
confusion matrix. At the time of implementation of the model any one of the
approaches is chosen from defining the model to use of predefined models
from libraries.
